### Welcome!

<p align="justify">Networks are the essential glue between the various components of interconnected systems, which are ubiquitous. But not only are they important, they also present many challenges and offer multiple research opportunities, especially in the emerging area of Data Science and Analysis. We live in the era where everything is perceived, transmitted and stored as a piece of potentially valuable information. However, its collection, process and usage present a great challenge due to the great size of the data, which can also be observed through the exploitation of colossal data centers. <br/>
I'm interested in the expendability and robustness of communicating systems dedicated to a wide range of applications, from big data analytics to the Internet of Things, and fundamentally dependent on the function of networks. Currently I have been working on the imporovement and assessment of the accuracy of the <a href="http://grip.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/?length=10&start=0&ts_start=2022-10-04T17%3A24&ts_end=2022-10-05T17%3A24&min_susp=80&max_susp=100&event_type=moas" target="_blank"> Global Routing Intelligence Platform</a> (GRIP) that detects and eveluates Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking events. <br/>
