### Welcome!

<p align="justify">Networks are the essential glue between the various components of interconnected systems, which are ubiquitous. But not only are they important, they also present many challenges and offer multiple research opportunities, especially in the emerging area of Data Science and Analysis. We live in the era where everything is perceived, transmitted and stored as a piece of potentially valuable information. However, its collection, process and usage present a great challenge due to the great size of the data, which can also be observed through the exploitation of colossal data centers. <br/>
I'm interested in the expendability and robustness of communicating systems dedicated to a wide range of applications, from big data analytics to the Internet of Things, and fundamentally dependent on the function of networks. Currently, I have been working on the improvement and assessment of the accuracy of the <a href="http://grip.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/?length=10&start=0&ts_start=2022-10-04T17%3A24&ts_end=2022-10-05T17%3A24&min_susp=80&max_susp=100&event_type=moas" target="_blank"> Global Routing Intelligence Platform</a> (GRIP) that detects and evaluates Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking events. <br/>

<p align="justify">Additionally, I have deen working on the design and implementation MORP4, a programmable data plane framework implementing a “dynamic” network telescope. MORP4 adaptively tracks unused space of an organization’s network with configurable time and space granularity and captures only traffic directed towards unused addresses. <br/>

### About me
<p align="justify">
I am a third-year Ph.D. Student at the Computer Science department at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/" target="_blank">Prof. Alberto Dainotti</a> in the <a href="https://inetintel.notion.site/Internet-Intelligence-Research-Lab-d186184563d345bab51901129d812ed6" target="_blank">Internet Intelligence Lab</a>. <br/>
I have a Diploma (equivalent to Integrated M.Eng.) in <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> from the National Technical University of Athens, where I conducted my thesis research under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/76" target="_blank">Prof. Symeon Papavassiliou</a>.
